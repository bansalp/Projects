Statistics above indicate that a node in the graph that has fairly high in-link count may not necessarily have a high PageRank value. This shows that in-link count and PageRank value for a given node in the graph do not follow direct relationship. 

We can speculate from the title of the pages with high PageRank values that these may be a home page for any website or can be a copyright, a general disclaimer or an important information page. These are the pages that may be linked to each and every page specific to a particular website. For e.g.: ‘The Economist: Copyright Notice’, ‘General Disclaimer’ and ‘Important Information’ pages have an in-link to ’Home page of the Economist’.

No. Not all the documents are the ones that the user may want to see in response to an appropriate query. For e.g.: When a user plugs in ‘The Economist Home page’; he would probably want to see ‘Home page of the Economist’ and not ‘The Economist: Copyright Notice’ or ‘General Disclaimer’.
